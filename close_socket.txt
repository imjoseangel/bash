netstat -np

use lsof -p $PID and find the file descriptor (4th column)

# lsof -p 1737 | grep "(deleted)"
apache2 1737 root    6w   REG    0,25        0  207401  (deleted)/var/log/apache2/other_vhosts_access.log

4th column is 6w, meaning file descriptor 6 and it was opened for writing (w).

Then:

gdb -p $PID
p close($FD)

eg:

gdb -p 1737
.....
(gdb) p close(6)
$1 = 0
...
Quit anyway? (y or n) y
Detaching from program: /usr/lib/apache2/mpm-prefork/apache2, process 1737





netstat -np
You get a source/destination ip:port portstate pid/processname map
locate the the socket's file descriptor in the process

lsof -np $pid
You get a list: process name, pid, user,fileDescriptor, ... a connection string.

Locate the matching fileDescriptor number for the connection.

Now connect the process:
gdb -p $pid
Now close the socket:

call close($fileDescritor)

//does not need ; at end.
Then detach:

quit
And the socket is closed.
